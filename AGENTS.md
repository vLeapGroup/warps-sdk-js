# Project Instructions

## Code Style

- Use arrow functions
- Use types over interfaces
- All code must be coherent in the same coding style as the existing codebase.
- Do not use workarounds and strive for clean code.
- We keep code brief rather than verbose.
- Business logic should be tested, in tests that are clean, follow existing testing patterns, and code style is brief and inline (as much as makes sense for readability)
- In tests, mock as little as necessary. Always use the real functions to test and don't mock other related functions, unless they call external services.
